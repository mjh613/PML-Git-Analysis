### How I built the model
1. Created 4 crossvalidation samples (10% each) from the training set.
1. Then created a working training set from the samples that did NOT contain any of the data in the cross-validation samples.
1. I removed all columns that were characters or had no variance
1. Did a principal components analysis to determine the components that would be needed to predict 95% of the data, which resulted in 27 components.
1. I created a transformed training set (trainpc) using the 27 components.
1. I ran a "random forests" model to find the best model fit.

### Use of cross-validation
1. I used the final model from the rf to predict on the four cross validation training sets I created at the beginning.

### Out of sample error
1. Based on the test set, I loaded the 


### Predicting 20 cases
